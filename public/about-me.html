    <h1>About me</h1>
    <article>
        <p>My name is Isaac Micheal a native of Kogi State and Ebira by tribe. I studied Computer Engineering and graduated from the Federal University of Techology Minna, Niger State. I was deployed for my NYSC to Camp at Ikare Ondo State on October 2022 and ended service November 2023 of which by the grace of God my service was very impactful to the students, schools, communities and the regional church. It was quite a wonderful and unforgettabble experience with massive outreaches. After service I relocated to Lagos State, a place where I was born an brought up, after 3 month of staying at home I got employment by Great Brand Nigeria Limited Company. I was employed as an IT System Administrator with my Regional IT been a very nice man Mr. Ibrahim. I Left after 11months cause I was not convenient with was the company deals with as a child of God. I later met with Professor Akinniyi the CEO of Tydacomm Telecommunications Company who took me in as a management trainee and house me in VGC. The details go on and on as I trust God for the best to get into software engineering properly. Becoming a creative mind in the industry</p>
